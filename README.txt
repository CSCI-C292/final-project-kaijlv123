Hi this is my final project "Flow"
You might see the folder name is not Flow but water shader.
This is because I used a water shader project as the basement of the project for water rendering and shader complement.
Please got to the Asset -> Scene -> Flow.unity. It will load my works.
Some shader or animation or rendering might not available in old unity version. it's working perfect on my device, but just in case
if you encounter any missing material/shader/texture due to pipeline or setting, please let me know through slack or email (kaijlv@iu.edu)
Thank you and merry christmas~
